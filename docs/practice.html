                        <p class="descriptions">
                        One of the biggest things I am noticing when exploring websites and looking at the design layouts used, is, the home page will usually consist 
                        of a large image taking up the full width of the page and a height that will fill up a desktop screen. Sometimes this may be the only thing on the screen,
                        if you take this website for example, all you will see is a full screen images of Bear Grylls and two pieces of text, one of which is the Adventure in the background and
                        the other is the scroll progress bar.<br><br>
                        I find that when you see a big picture it encourages you straight away to scroll down the page to see what else is there, now on this page it has been done very cleverley.
                        When you scroll, the image of Bear will start to zoom in slightly and the scroll progress bar will move with it. When you have scrolled in enough it will transform into a new image and when you scroll into that,
                        it will transform into a page containing text and pictures. This in my opinion is a great design and makes it really interactive.

                    <div class="pimage-containers">
                        <img class="pimages" src="images/p5.png" alt="A Screen Shot Of A Web Page">
                        <p class="descriptions">
                        Another one of Bear (if you want to know more about why i liked this website, check out the video on the home page). Again when looking through
                        websites, the pages i really like, i find have a very basic background. Very little colour is used, whites, blacks and greys are very popular on this 
                        particular website and it works really well because it encourages you to look at the pictures as that is where the colour is shown.<br><br>
                        Because the background is so plain it really makes the colours pop in the pictures and makes them stand out. Another use for the plain backgrounds is it makes it alot easier to 
                        break the page up just by using a change from black to white. This means i dont get bored of looking through the same white space but also is a great way 
                        of showing that the topic or content has changed.

                    <div class="pimage-containers">
                        <img class="pimages" src="images/p2.png" alt="A Screen Shot Of A Web Page & Images">
                        <p class="descriptions">
                        Lots of images, very little text!<br>
                        I dont know about you but as soon as I get on a webpage and I see it is just full of text, that much text that I dont know what to read first, I end up just clicking off or scrolling
                        through to see if there is a picture or video that will make more sense. It is proven these days that the majority or people learn quicker through video and images rather than reading.<br><br>
                        What I like to see on a web page is as minimal text as possible, unless of course it is an article or a review etc., I want to see images related to the website and the topic in question 
                        and i want to see really crisp high definition images. If I see that they are pixelated and miscoloured, it gives me the impression that the website isnt to a good standard and I am 
                        not going to get a good experience from it.<br><br>In this example you can see a plain white background with minimal text and a really crisp high coloured image of a motorbike. There is then a link below
                        the image taking me to another page containing more information about that particular bike. So this gives users the option to see more information and read through in more detail if preferred.

                        <img class="pimages" src="images/p6.png" alt="A Screen Shot Of A Web Page Navigation">
                        <p class="descriptions">
                        Navigation buttons for me are a big part of a webpage and if they dont look right then it will affect the whole website. The two methods I like for navigation buttons are either a really simple
                        set up where they are spaced evenly at the top of a page, easy to see and easy to navigate between, or when they are hidden completely in a hamburger, (no not an actual burger, the three lines you 
                        see in the corner of a header) usually found on mobile devices. The hamburger method allows a really clean webpage and is the most modern and up to date design.<br><br>
                        The hamburger will contain the navigation buttons so when you click on the lines to open it up you reveal each main page and you can navigate through normally. This is a great design and really gives off
                        that techinical feel, and to me, offers a better experience. Saying that, I have chosen for my website to stick with the more simple navigation structure and show each main page button at the top of the pages.
                        To do the hamburger the way I would like to and really give it a good design, I need to add javascript and I havent quite got that far yet. My navigation format was inspired by this one you see above but I decided to keep it in 
                        a banner due to the images I was using throughout the site.

                        <img class="pimages" src="images/p7.png" alt="A Screen Shot Of A Web Page Footer">
                        <p class="descriptions">
                        Every website will contain a footer and generally the footer will hold all of the "less interesting" information, this could be contact details, privacy policy, copyright details, site maps, terms of use, 
                        social media links, the list goes on!<br><br>
                        But, in my opinion a footer still needs to have a good design, you dont want to have a really amazing website and then just lose the experience at the very end. If you have
                        important information in the footer then you still need to make it look intersting to a user to encourage them to explore that information. As you can see from the example above, the footer on KTM's website is pretty basic,
                        but as it contains alot of information on the company, KTM news, legal information etc., I think it would be difficult to design this in a more interactive way due to the amount of content it needs to hold but it does the job it needs too and it still fits in 
                        perfectly with the rest of the website.<br><br>
                        For my website I have gone down the same simple route for the footer as I dont have any specific information it needs to contain and I dont want to have a really interactive footer when the rest of the website does not
                        have the same design. However, on my landing page I chose to incorprate a smart footer that is hidden until you hover over it and when it opens it contains a contact form for users to contact me and Mat. If I had more content for the footer on the rest of the pages
                        then I would consider doing the same for each page but then I would also need to do a similar design to the navigation so that the theme is consistent.
