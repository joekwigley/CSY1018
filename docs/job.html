                                <h4>So you want to be a developer?</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Have you ever looked at a website and thought about the layout, the pictures, how the buttons work and wondered
                                        “who makes a website and how can I do it?” or have you done some shopping online and thought “where do the all 
                                        the items come from and who updates it?” Well here is a little insight into designing a website.<br><br>
                                        Now a lot of work goes into building a website and most of the time there will be multiple people working on a 
                                        site at any one time. But if we wanted to break it down a bit, let’s look at who does what. The easiest way for 
                                        me to remember the different parts of a site build is breaking it down into two sides, front-end developers and 
                                        back-end developers (or to some people the light side of the force and the dark side!).</p>

                                        <h4>Front-End Developer</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        So, let’s look at a front-end developer first. When you see a web page and look at its layout, the pictures, the text etc., 
                                        that is the work of a front-end developer. The front end of a website is the part that users interact with, everything that 
                                        you see when you’re navigating around the Internet, from fonts and colours to dropdown menus and animations, is a combo of 
                                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript being controlled by your computer’s browser.<br><br>

                                        <span class="highlights">What skills do you need to be a front-end developer? </span><br><br>
                                        Front-end developers are responsible for the websites user facing code and the structure of its user experience. 
                                    </p>
                            </section>
                            <section class="middle">
                                    <p>
                                        In order to do this, you need to be efficient in three main languages: HTML, CSS & Javascript programming as well as a framework like 
                                        Bootstrap or AngularJS which allow a good-looking design regardless of the device being used. Without going into too much detail 
                                        an easy way to remember is, a front-end developer is responsible for the interior design or a house that’s been built by a back-end developer.<br><br>
                                        <span class="highlights">Now, for the really important bit, how much does a front-end developer earn?</span><br><br> Let’s say you are starting out as a junior developer in central London, 
                                        you would be looking at a salary of around £30k a year. After a few years and some experience under your belt, the average salary for a mid-weight developer is around £40-£45k.<br>
                                        <span class="job-links">An example of a front end developer job can be found <a href="http://www.jobsite.co.uk/job/959709228?&utm_medium=aggregator&utm_source=indeedSponsored&utm_campaign=MP1_IT&cid=msearche_indeedSponsored___MP1_IT_" target="_blank">here</a>.</span>
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Back-End Developer</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        So, what makes the front end of a website possible? Where is all the data stored, how does the website know that those shoes you have been waiting 
                                        for are finally back in stock? This is where the back-end comes in. The back end of a website consists of a server, an application and a database.<br><br>
                                    </p>
                            </section>
                        
                            <section class="right">
                                    <p>
                                        A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place.
                                        So, skills? In order to make the server, application and database communicate with each other you need to be competent in languages like PHP, Ruby, Python and Java to build an 
                                        application and tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save or change data and serve it back to the user in front end code.<br><br>
                                        How much will you earn I hear? Again, if you look at starting as a junior developer you are likely to be around the £30k and then going on to hit anything from £50k-£70k in 
                                        central London with enough experience.<br>

                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Full Stack Developer</h4>
                                    <p>
                                    <span class="highlights">Enter The Jack of all trades!</span> The idea is that a full stack developer can work cross-functionally on the full “stack” of technology, 
                                        meaning they can do both the front-end and the back-end, they are the full package. Now this doesn’t mean they are experts in both area’s but it does mean 
                                        they need to have a functional knowledge and the ability to work on both sides.<br><br>
                                        Full stack developers are becoming more and more popular and a good one can fetch onwards of £70k a year in central London. So, you may be thinking that 
                                        this is the route for you, just bear in mind, you need to know your stuff!<br>
