                            <h3 class="log-heading">In October 2017, I made the decision to go back to school as a mature student to study web design.</h3><br>
                            <p class="log-text">
                                I didn’t have any prior experience with web language and web applications, all of my computer experience 
                                was from being at work and school and learning how to use Microsoft Office.
                                A lot of schools now teach code from the age of 11, but unfortunately, I did not have that luxury. In the three months that I have been 
                                studying part time, I have learned way more than I ever expected too. I have come from not knowing what 
                                CSS & HTML are, to becoming adequate and confident in starting to create a website.<br><br>                             
                                It hasn’t been an easy three months though, I have had to put a lot of extra hours into my learning outside 
                                of University and a lot of hours into the website I am putting together for my assignment. One thing I have 
                                definitely come to terms with, it is not straight forward! Coding to me is like learning a completely different 
                                language, and not just one language. I have only scratched the surface with HTML & CSS and my brain has been 
                                hurting since the day I started.<br><br>
                                It isn’t just the code you need to learn, it’s everything else that goes with it. You might be able to pick up coding 
                                quickly but you still need to understand how developer tools work, how you can validate your code, how you can validate your colour codes
                                to make sure that the text color you choose is readable against the background you have chosen, where to 
                                look for the most up to date designs and waht you should be looking for, there is a lot to take in. But with that, it is very rewarding, I have spent hours 
                                and hours trying to get something to work on my site, and a lot of the time it is in the last couple hours of the day where 
                                everything comes together, that piece of the site you have been trying to put together for days and suddenly it clicks and 
                                you get it, seeing the work pay off, to me, that’s what I find rewarding. If you want to see what I mean about the tools you need to get familiar with,
                                check out the examples below:</p><br>

                                <h5 class="picture-heading"> HTML Code Validation</h5><br>

                                <img class="images" src="images/5.png" alt="Proof of CSS Code Validation"><br><br>

                                <p class="log-text">I am sure that everyone has their own way of working, I was so eager to get started and put what I have learnt into motion 
                                that I ended up re-doing half my website at least 4 times. One of the stages you can see below, this ended up in me losing a huge amount of time but to me it 
                                was not time wasted because all of those hours, rewriting code and researching better ways to do things, it got me understanding
                                what I was doing more and more.  From experience, I have learnt that reading how to do something isn’t the same as doing it. 
                                Everything new can feel scary and daunting but if you don’t give it a try you’re not going to get anywhere. If you want to get 
                                good at something, don’t read it in a book or watch it on a video, do it!</p><br><br>
